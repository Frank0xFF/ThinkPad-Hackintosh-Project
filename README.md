# ThinkPad-Hackintosh-Project

I want to create a EFI database here, that we can see EFIs for newer ThinkPads. It would be easier to have a big DB better than checking 1000 different hubs.

Feel free to give me suggestions or comments, or share your EFI with me to publish here to help people.
Tested on Thinkpad E490 ond E590

OS Version: Majove 10.15.1

Clover version: 5099

This EFI works for E490 E590 E490s maybe works for T490 L490 T590 L590 T490s. I suggest, you use your **own DSDT** or use Rehabman PATCH. I take no responsibility here.


**What Works:**

Nvme \
Ethernet \
Backlight level (use brightness slide to get hotkeys working) \
Sound \
Hotkeys for sound \
Internal Speakers \
Internal Mic \
Battery Level Status (use RehabMan patch to create your own) \
Type A USB Ports \
HDMI Video and Audio Output \
Built In MicroSD Reader \
Headphone Jack \
Hibernation \
Webcam \
SATA drivers \
SideCar (over USB Cable or USB WiFi, no latency) \
Bluetooth as well as bluetooth earphones, airpods... \
Shows correct battery serial number and cycles \
ThinkPad Clickpads :) \
ThinkPad Pointer :) \


**Does not work:**

Wifi because of Intel Wireless-AC 9260 (no chance it works, we need to change the wifi card) \
Gestures with 3 and 4 fingers (normally it worked, it is workable) \
Battery Life Estimation \ (it is makebla)
Sometimes after sleep slow two finger scrolling (it can be corrected) \
 
**Have not checked:**

Type C USB Video Output
